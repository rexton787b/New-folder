I had a **terrible** time with this. It just wont listen to the css page for some reason. I re made the link and checked the classes and it still wont work. So frustrating. I even went back to look at some code i wrote in the past and i have it the same and it works on _it_ but not _this_. Please look at my css page so you can see i added styling despite it not showing up for some reason.
