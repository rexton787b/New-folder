## Assignment 3: Choose Your Adventure Story

### Story Summary

My story is about a character i made up and it was supposed to have you win based on what weapon you picked and give a reason why but i couldnt figure out how to do this.

### Key Takeaways

i **Really** dont understand this js stuff. i try to follow along in class but it doesnt make sense. it doesnt help that its very tedious and needs to be perfect or it wont work. Im glad i at least got the start quest button to work.
