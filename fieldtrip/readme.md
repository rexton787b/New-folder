## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My website would be pretty simple. there would be 4 pages. The home page, a page for paintings, a page for sculptures, and a page for other types of art.

### Core Webpages

The home page would feature a section describing the museum and its history, along with the museums mission and values. The next page would be the page about the paintings which would feature pictures of the paintings with a discription about it, when its from, and who painted it. The next page for sculptures would basically be the same but feature the scultures in the museum, and the last page would feature other types of artwork that dont fit into those categories.

### Design Choices

The website would have a nav at the top to access the pages and i would use colors like tan and brown because i feel like i saw a lot of colors like that in the museum. then i would have the pics of the items on the left with the desciption and info about the item on the right.
